1. What is Nodejs?

Nodejs is an asynchronous non blocking io framework developed based on google's V8.
Some good features are -
1. Its very fast.
2. Its event driven.
3. Single threaded but highly scalable.

2. What is latest version of Nodejs?

3. What is NPM?
NMP is node package manager.It manages all the node packages.
We can download packages from NPM. It tracks the history, ranking of the packages to help
developer to find the stable packages.

npm install <package_name> --save

4. Why Nodejs is single threaded?

Nodejs runs using single thread at least from a Node.js developer point
of view. Under the hood Node.js uses many thread through libuv.	

5. Mention the steps by which you can async in Nodejs?

6. How Nodejs overcomes the problem of blocking I/O?

Nodejs runs using single thread at least from a Node.js developer point
of view. Under the hood Node.js uses many thread through libuv.	

Every I/O requires a callback - once they are done they are pushed onto the event loop
for execution. The I/O operation will be executed in different thread not blocking the
main execution thread. When the opersation is completed then callback executed in 
main thread by the event loop.


7. What is callback in Nodejs?

Callback is a first class function in javascript which is passed as an argument in an asynchronous
functions. This is called when the asynchronous operation is completed.

Ex- Suppose reading a file takes long time, we can use concept of callback here.
When the task of reading the file is completed then callback function will be called with data.
The task reading will be executed in different thread other than main execution thread and when its done
then callback will be executed in main thread.
